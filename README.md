# Pizza menu project

## installation:
npm install

## start:
npm run dev


## Exercise: 
Step 1) Create a pizza menu as a list of pizza descriptions. Each pizza description should display the name of the pizza in a bold character followed by a comma separated list of ingredients

Step 2) For each pizza calculate the selling price. This price of a pizza is the sum of the base price (5) and the price of the different ingredients of the pizza.

Step 3) (Bonus)
Add a text input with a label "allergies". The user may input an ingredient that he is allergic to and automatically the menu should filter out the pizzas containing the ingredient
